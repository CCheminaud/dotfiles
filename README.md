## Getting started

Clone this repository using `yadm`.

```

The `clone` command will attempt to check out all files that exist in the repository.
If a file already exists locally and has content that differs from the one in the repository,
the local file will be left unmodified and youâ€™ll have to review and resolve the differences.
