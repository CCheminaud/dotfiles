# dotfiles

These are all my dotfiles that I use everyday. Feel free to take what you want, but at your own risk.

It mainly target macOS system.

## Highlights

- Shell configuration for [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) and Zsh
- Fast and colored prompt with [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) configuration, aliases...
- Vim ready for use (using [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/))
- Keeping the system up to date with [Topgrade](https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade)
- Some system command alternatives ([bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom), [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza))
- Everything is managed by [yadm](https://yadm.io/)

## Getting started

Clone this repository using `yadm`.

```shell
yadm clone https://github.com/CCheminaud/dotfiles.git
yadm status
```

The `clone` command will attempt to check out all files that exist in the repository.
If a file already exists locally and has content that differs from the one in the repository,
the local file will be left unmodified and youâ€™ll have to review and resolve the differences.

### Fish

Install the required packages with Homebrew.

```shell
brew install fish fisher
```

Then start a new session with Fish and proceed with plugin installation.\
If needed, a private configuration file can be created too.

```shell
fisher update
touch ~/.config/fish/config.private.fish
```
